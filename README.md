# Machine_learning_coursera_Stanford_uni (Still in progress)

This is my lecture notes and my solution to the quizes and assignment of machine learning on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. This online course is really useful and can give you a clear understanding of what is machine learning. Higly recommend to try this course and do the tasks, if you get stucked, feel free to check my code :)
